**Summer Project 2016**

In the Summer of 2016, Team Albania was blessed to be able to be a part of a new ministry in Albania: Young Professionals. The Dallas squad sent 22 people across three teams: High School in Tirana, High School in Elbasan, and Young Professionals in Tirana. While High School ministries continued to build upon previous relationships with students, the Young Professionals team engaged Albanian culture from the perspective of working adults in the form of seminars and a retreat.
