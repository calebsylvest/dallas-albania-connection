**Summer Project 2018**

This summer we are returning to three cities in Albania: Tirana, Korça, and Elbasan to share the good news of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We will be partnering with Cru Albania for high school ministry and young professionals, with whom we have long-standing partnerships. Trip dates are (1) Jun 29-Jul 9, and (2) Jul 7-Jul 16, 2018. This year will mark the sixth that we will have traveled to Albania for the Summer Project.

We are looking for committed workers to join us in 2018. If you have a heart for sharing the love of God with others, you will be valuable. We have an application process whereby we take applications, interview applicants, and assign teams. Once teams are formed, we will begin team meetings to prepare for our trip(s). The Google form application is below.

For more details about this summer (and before applying), read the Info Sheet and Calendar files below. For questions, see the Contact information (also way below).
