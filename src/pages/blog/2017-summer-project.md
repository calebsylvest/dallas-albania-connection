**Summer Project 2017**

Summer 2017 brought Team Albania to a new city for High School ministry: Korça. There, a small team partnered with a local church (a new concept that is part of the Cru Albania’s strategy to reach new people) to host summer camp where new and diverse high schoolers were engaged with the Gospel. In addition, Tirana High School, Elbasan High School, and Tirana Young Professional camps continued. Team Albania 2017 was 32 people strong, and for the first time encompassed two separate weeks of travel.
