## So you're going on a summer project?

That's great!  You're going to have a blast!  Putting on a summer camp where
you get to meet students, share the Gospel, and see people's lives change is
an amazing experience.  But there's a lot to do between here and there.

One thing that a lot of people stumble over when they sign up to go on a summer
project is support raising.  This is often one of the most difficult parts of
trip preparation, and can be downright frightening for some.  Fortunately we're
here to help!  There are a lot of great resources and training for you to take 
advantage of.

So let's say a quick prayer and dive in, shall we?

> Lord,
> We know that You are sovereignly in control of everything.  You know my going
> out and my lying down (Psalms 139:3), You know that I have committed to this
> summer project.  Thank you for this opportunity Lord.  Thank you for the chance
> to grow in my faith, and to learn to trust in You through difficult situations.
> I ask Lord that You provide for this work in a manner that dwarfs my expectations.
> Please bring in the full support that I need, so that like Paul, "in preaching
> the gospel I may offer it free of charge" (1 Corinthians 9:18)

## A Biblical Perspective on Support Raising

The question has been raised before, and you might be asking it now: *why shouldn't
I simply write a check and support the mission myself?*

Great question!  The answer has nothing to do with how much money you make, or
whether you would normally donate this amount, or anything like that.  The answer
has to do with the spiritual purpose of support raising.

Through the support raising process, God is going to work both *in* and *through*
you.  

#### He will work *in* you by:

- Strengthening your faith as you rely on Him to bring in the support,
- Building your relationship with Him as you daily pray for your specific support need,
- Pushing you out of your comfort zone as you make a specific ask of people.

#### He will work *through* you by:

- Inviting your ministry partners to share in the joy of the work you will be doing,
- Building a prayer base that will be your most effective tool for ministry success,
- Blessing your ministry partners with the opportunity to be generous,
- Giving you an opportunity and a motivation to talk about your faith with those
  in your life who may or may not have a relationship with Christ.

#### Your Calling

Were you called to come on this project?  Almost certainly yes.  God has worked
in you already to bring you to a decision to go this summer.  However it would
be a fatal mistake to believe that everyone who signs up for the trip is called.
This is an opportunity to confirm your calling.  We can be absolutely sure of this,
that **if you are called to go on the project, your support will come in**.

> And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God,
> even as Aaron was. 
> <footer class="blockquote-footer">Hebrews 5:4</footer>

> for Godâ€™s gifts and His call are irrevocable.
> <footer class="blockquote-footer">Romans 11:29</footer>

If you are a believer in christ, you absolutely are called to be on mission.  
If you are called to be on this *specific* mission, He will provide beyond what
you could expect.

> Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine,
> according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church
> and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
> <footer class="blockquote-footer">Ephesians 3:20-21</footer>

So be strong and courageous (Joshua 1:9)!  God is on your side and He will bring
in the funds.
