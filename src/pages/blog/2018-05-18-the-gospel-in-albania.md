Albania is a very unique place.  The openness towards Americans, pride in their religious tolerance, and history of radical communist atheism make it very easy to have a conversation about faith there.  There's an interest, a hunger for spiritual discussions, that provides ample opportunity to experience the unique blend of Islam, Orthodox Christianity, Secular Materialism, and Paganism that exists in various parts of the country.  Understanding that blend, and how it drives their culture and is driven by their history, can open up amazing opportunities to sharing the Gospel.

I once heard someone describe the culture of Haiti as 60% Catholic, 30% Protestant, 100% voodoo.  That pithy phrase gives insight into the fact that so many even of professing Christians turn to the local witch doctor for power over things they can't control.  In Albania we could almost give a similar description: **70% Muslim, 30% Christian (Catholic & Orthodox), 100% Atheist.**

<span class="callout">Tip #1: Don't argue with an Albanian about Islam, because you probably know more than he does.</span>
I can't number for you how many professing Muslims I met who have never gone to Mosque, never read the Koran, and have no clue what the Five Pillars are of Islam.  Similarly with the Catholic and Orthodox, despite the giant Orthodox and Catholic churches in the center of Tirana.  This is amazing to me because everyone I meet is ready to discuss faith - they want to have the conversations, they just have no idea _how_ to think about faith.

## 100% Atheist

Their atheism stems from the almost 50 years that they spent under the iron thumb of one of the most brutal Communist regimes that ever existed.  In 1967, the dictator Enver Hoxha declared Albania to be the world's first officially Atheistic state.  All religion was outlawed.  Churches and Mosques were shut down, priests and imams expelled or worse.  To practice religion in any capacity carried severe penalties.  For the most part, Albanians forgot their faith.

When the regime fell in 1992, thousands gathered for the first services of the Catholic church in Shkodra.  They packed the church out the door.
Similarly, the first showing of the Jesus film in the center of Tirana drew crowds spilling out of the conference hall into the street.  People were hungry for this thing that had been denied them for 50 years.  This strange concoction - 50 years of enforced atheism and a sudden reopening to faith - bred the fertile ground for the Gospel that we enjoy today.

<span class="callout">Tip #2: Be Bold in opening up the faith conversation.</span>
It also bred a strange hybrid culture.  One that recognizes religion as central to its identity, but has no idea how faith works in practice.  Once it was legal again to have faith, people began to look back in their history and see that their grandfather was an Imam, or that they come from a Catholic region of the country.  Therefore I must be Catholic, or Orthodox, or Muslim - so goes the thinking.  To deny that would be to deny my family & my heritage.

## Faith as Cultural Identity

Many of the CRU staff in Albania have experienced this union of faith with cultural identity in unfortunate ways.  We as Christians teach that you have a new identity in Christ; "The old has gone, the new is here!" ([2 Corinthians 5:17](http://biblehub.com/niv/2_corinthians/5.htm)).  For the families watching this transformation occur, it can seem that they are turning their back on their family heritage.  This is especially true if the new believer comes from a Muslim background.

> a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.  A man’s 
> enemies will be the members of his own household.

<span class="callout">Tip #3: Be sensitive to what it might cost them.  Ask them to trust Christ, not to become a Christian.</span>
Albanians experience the truth of this claim by Jesus in a way that we can't understand as Americans.  For us, faith and cultural identity are not linked.  I am an American regardless of whether I am Christian, Muslim, Atheist, Buddhist, whatever.  But an Albanian often will be judged by what village he or she is from.  This will identify their family, heritage, religion, social status, and many other things.
Albanians are also very proud of their heritage, and having a son or daughter who converts their religion can seem like spurning that heritage, bringing shame on the whole family.

## The Honor/Shame Dynamic

Albania is an honor/shame culture.  This stands in contrast to America's guilt/innocence culture.
Where we are more individualistic, they prize familial connections.  Where we focus on an internal
sense of right and wrong, they place more importance on an action's potential for bringing honor or
shame to themselves and their families.  Actions like converting to Christianity have the potential
to bring shame on a Muslim family.

<span class="callout">Tip #4: Show them that Christ wants to honor them far beyond any shame that men could heap on them.</span>
It's important to recognize the honor/shame dynamic in your conversations and to contextualize
the Gospel for them.  We Americans often talk about the Gospel in legal terms - God 'cancelled
our debt' or Jesus 'took the punishment we deserve'.  But Jesus also took the *shame* we deserve.
Our sins make us shameful creatures, not worthy of honor.  Worthy only to be turned away from
in disgust.  On the Cross, Jesus was shamed in our place.  He hung naked and endured people
spitting on him, turning their backs on him, mocking him.  He was ostracized and condemned
with the lowest of the low.  And yet - God raised Him from the dead and bestowes honor
and glory on Him.  He freely invites us into that honorable place through adoption
as sons and daughters of the King.  We make that same transition from low-down dirty
worthless sinner to raised up glorified and *honored* children of the King.
