One of the greatest things that I have learned this year about international missions is the variety of ministries all over the world that are doing significant work for the Kingdom.  During May 18-22, 2018, I was able to witness God's creativity at work through Campus Crusade's Leader Impact Conference in Siófok, Hungary on the southern coast of Lake Balaton - Europe's largest Lake. 

The vision of Leader Impact: 

> "We believe God puts leaders in positions of influence in all segments of society and in all the nations of the world to fulfill His purpose. We exist to encourage and empower these leaders to step into their God-given role as a transformational leader—to experience life to the full, not satisfied by status or success, but by stepping deeply into the call of God’s plan that was uniquely designed for them.  As these leaders join with others, integrate their faith into their home and work life and form a vision for their city, we believe that God will use us to transform our cities, nations, and ultimately the world for Christ."

Leader Impact is currently in 8 countries with plans eventually to be in 20 countries and 40 cities in the next few years!

During my time at the Leader Impact Conference, I got to meet leaders from Young Professional and Business Leader ministries from all over Eastern and Central Europe.  Those country teams present included Albania (2), Poland, Ukraine, Moldova, Czech Republic, Macedonia, Romania (3), and of course the Cru Leadership team from Hungary.  Partnered with each team were "organizational partners" from non-Cru organizations that were tasked with helping the teams with Dreaming, Designing, and Doing.  Each day was devoted to one of those themes with the ultimate goal at the end of conference of each team being able to do the following: 1) know at what development stage their organization currently resides 2) have concrete steps in place for where they want to go next and 3) understanding of how to take those steps.

My top three takeaways from the conference are as follows:

1. God is incredibly creative in how he is using the various professional ministries all over Eastern and Central Europe.  The stories of life change from business leaders in each of these countries kept coming one after another.  I heard several specific examples of high level business professionals in multiple countries coming to Christ and that having a transformational effect on everyone around them.

2. The global body of Christ fulfills it purpose by meeting the needs of others, especially those within the church.  Two of the teams that I am most closely aligned with, the Albania and Poland teams, were able to sit down with each other and talk about how to replicate the success that the Albania team has experienced in the Young Professionals ministry.  In turn, the Poland team was able to ask questions and get detailed answers about what their next steps could be.

3. God is greater than culture and yet specifically uses cultural differences to meet needs and execute His plan for redeeming the earth.  Some of the cultures represented at the weekend had very different organizational styles than others.  Some cultures are highly organizationally focused while others are more relational.  And yet, each one needs the other to accomplish God's plan for the Kingdom.  A great example of this is how God is using our American team from Watermark Church and the Cru Albania team.  Americans culturally tend to be organizationally oriented and yet many times lack relational capability.  I certainly can fall into that category as I can be more interested in getting my to-do list accomplished than loving the people God has entrusted around me.  When we go to Albania or host our Albanian friends, I get reminded that people are not projects and that our God is incredibly relational.  I also get reminded that coffee is for much more than energy in the morning, but a convenient excuse for bonding with others which helps us be more effective in communicating the gospel and loving people as Christ intended.  In turn, our Albanian friends get tips from us on how to infuse more organizational capability onto their teams allowing them to be more effective.  Its truly a win-win situation orchestrated by God.

When will the next Leader Impact Conference happen?  I'm not sure but I hope to get another invite and I can't wait to see what God is going to do next!
